"Life is a matter of choices, and every choice you make makes you"- John C Maxwell. At present, many students make mistakes in their preference list of colleges because of various reasons like inaccurate analysis of colleges, lack of knowledge, and apprehensive prediction. Later, they end up regretting the same after allotment. Our application addresses this issue of the student admission community. The application uses data mining and data analysis techniques.

Objectives of this project work are as follows. • To help students to fill their preferences at the time of option-entry process accurately. To ease of making better choices of college before allotment.
